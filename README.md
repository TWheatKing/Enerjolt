- **Find, Extract, Survive:** Scavenge for priceless **Contaminated Loot** that can only be used once extracted. Call for extraction at a Beacon, but be ready—you'll have to survive a relentless horde while the timer counts down.
- **Winner Takes All:** Successfully extract and the prize is yours. Die, and your loot is dropped for any other player to steal.
- **Betrayal is an Option:** Configure PvP to be enabled or disabled. Go rogue, steal other players’ extractions, and fight for control of the zone’s most valuable resources.
